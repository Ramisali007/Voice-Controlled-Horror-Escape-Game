# Voice-Controlled Horror Escape Game

Welcome to the **Voice-Controlled Horror Escape Game**! This project is a 3D horror game where players interact with the environment using voice commands. The game leverages **Whisper AI** for speech-to-text transcription and **Panda3D** for the 3D game engine. Players can control objects like doors, flashlights, and closets using natural language commands.

## Project Overview

This project is a 3D horror game where players use voice commands to interact with the environment. The game uses:
- **Whisper AI** for transcribing voice commands.
- **Panda3D** for rendering the 3D environment.
- **PyAudio** for recording audio from the microphone.

Players can issue commands like:
- "Open the door"
- "Close the door"
- "Turn on the flashlight"
- "Shift door left/right"
- "Remove the door"
- "Add the door"

The game logs all commands with timestamps and generates **JSON** and **SRT** files for further analysis or subtitles.

## Features

- **Voice Control**: Use natural language commands to interact with the game.
- **3D Environment**: Built using Panda3D with realistic lighting and objects.
- **Command Logging**: Logs all commands with timestamps.
- **JSON and SRT Generation**: Generates JSON and SRT files for commands.
- **Flashlight Mechanic**: Turn on/off a flashlight to explore the environment.

## Usage

1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python horror_game.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to issue voice commands.
3. Press `Enter` to start recording a command.
4. The game will process the command and update the 3D environment.

### Example Commands

- **"Open the door"**: Moves the door to the open position.
- **"Close the door"**: Moves the door back to the closed position.
- **"Turn on the flashlight"**: Activates the flashlight.
- **"Shift door left"**: Moves the door to the left.
- **"Shift door right"**: Moves the door to the right.
- **"Remove the door"**: Removes the door from the scene.
- **"Add the door"**: Adds the door back to the scene.

## Generating JSON and SRT Files

The game automatically generates two files:
1. **`commands.json`**: Contains a log of all commands with timestamps.
   ```json
   [
       {
           "timestamp": 0.0,
           "command": "open the door"
       },
       {
           "timestamp": 5.0,
           "command": "close the door"
       }
   ]
   ```
2. **`commands.srt`**: Contains subtitles for the commands in SRT format.
   ```
   1
   0:00:00 --> 0:00:05
   open the door

   2
   0:00:05 --> 0:00:10
   close the door
   ```
